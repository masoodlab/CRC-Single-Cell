The CRC raw counts file and Metadata file can be download here.

You can download the three compressed Raw Count files (CRC_Raw_counts.z01, CRC_Raw_counts.z02 and CRC_Raw_counts) 
into the same folder and open them with a program like 7zip, winrar or winzip. 

Since files larger than 25 mb could not be uploaded to github, we divided the raw count file into 3 parts.
